# Disease Evolution Predictor GAN (DEP-GAN) using Irregulairty Map (IM)
This is provisional code of DEP-GAN using IM. All codes will be updated regularly. It is expected to publish the final version of the code before MICCAI 2019.

Explanation of DEP-GAN can be read in our the pre-print version of our MICCAI 2019 paper titled **Predicting the Evolution of White Matter Hyperintensities in Brain MRI using Generative Adversarial Networks and Irregularity Map** [[PDF]](https://doi.org/10.1101/662692).

This code/publication is part of [our research projects](https://febrianrachmadi.github.io/projects/):
 - Disease Evolution Predictor Deep Neural Networks
 - Characterisation of WMH in Brain MRI using Irregularity Map
